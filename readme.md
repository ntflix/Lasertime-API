## API Reference
The Lasertime API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer).
The API accepts JSON, multipart, and XML request bodies, returns JSON response bodies, and uses standard [HTTP response codes](https://httpstatuses.com) and authentication.

The order of parameters in request bodies is not important.

### Base URL
```http
https://api.lasertime.iron59.co.uk
```
The API may only be used with TLS.

# Authentication üîê
The Lasertime API supports [HTTP Basic authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication). This is because the amount of requests a user will be making is so small, that having JWT or sessions implemented simply wouldn't be worth the one request they would authenticate for.

>For every operation on the API using your account, such as [uploading a lasertime log](#Adding-a-Lasertime-entry-‚è±), the user ID/username will be extracted automatically from each request's basic-auth header.

You will use your Lasertime username and password for the username and password.

### The following request retrieves the user details of username `'freddy'` with password `'password'`
```bash
curl -G https://api.lasertime.iron59.co.uk/user \
    -u 'freddy:password'
```
```http
GET /user HTTP/1.1
Host: api.lasertime.iron59.co.uk
Authorization: Basic ZnJlZGR5OnBhc3N3b3Jk
Accept: */*

# Creating a user üë©‚Äçüíª
#### User requirements
* A user's username must be unique. The server will not accept an account creation request if the username is not unique.
* A user does not have to supply an email or last name.

Creating a user for the Lasertime service is as easy as a __POST__ request. No authentication is required to create a user at this stage.
